Goalism
Based heavily on Sanathan Dharma

Scriptures: None except maybe this page of doctrine

Tenets:

Goal: One must set a goal in life, and must consult as many people as possible in order to verify the morality and plausibility of stated goal
Duty: One must perform ones duty based on the above goal, this must be done in such a way which does not lead to harm to anyone else as much as possible. There are however instances such as war or upholding order where it may be necessary to inflict harm based on ones duty and this is acceptable to the extent deemed appropriate for such a situation
Action-Reaction: Like newtons third law of motion, any action can lead to reaction, and indeed one must carefully consider such an action
It is not a sin to gain or generate wealth. You have a right to take care of yourself
God is everywhere, we don't require a place of worship, but this is not a restriction and people who believe or sympathize with these beliefs can feel free.
Be good to everyone. Be polite, respectful, restrained. Absorb their wisdom. Avoid questioning their beliefs
Keep gaining knowledge, read everything, dont censor ideas from yourself, challenge your beliefs and challenge Hanagalianism, modify Hanagalianism to suit your needs.
Avoid personal proselytizing. Let people find this on their own if interested or tell them about it if they ask. You do not need to leave your religion to join this one, feel free to adopt parts of this or the whole of these tenets.
